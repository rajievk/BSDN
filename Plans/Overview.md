## Government Pension Plans
- The **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** is a contributory, earnings-related social insurance program. It forms one of the two major components of Canada's public retirement income system, the other component being **Old Age Security (OAS)**. Other parts of Canada's retirement system are private pensions, either employer-sponsored or from tax-deferred individual savings (known in Canada as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan).
- The CPP mandates all employed Canadians who are 18 years of age and over to contribute a prescribed portion of their earnings income to a federally administered pension plan. The plan is administered by Employment and Social Development Canada on behalf of employees in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which operates an equivalent plan, the **Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**.
